that are close to it, using the method of the Rav Mordechai Breuer,
taken from our online version at:

http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/k/k0.htm

Our Bibles conform completely to the RaMBaM's Laws of Torah Scrolls
Chapter 8's details on correct division of paragraphs (according to
the Yemenite manuscripts of Mishneh Torah, which differ from the usual
Vilna editon) and it is proper for a scribe to use them as the basis
for writing a kosher Torah scroll.
